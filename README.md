# MCP Training — fastmcp test projects

A learning project for building MCP (Model Context Protocol) tests and small, personalized MCP servers for internal applications. This repository follows and extends the freeCodeCamp *MCP Basic* tutorial approach, and adds practical examples using `fastmcp` and other tools to help you level up your skills and build lightweight, repeatable servers for internal use.

## Why this project

- Learn the fundamentals of MCP testing and server creation using a guided, hands-on approach.
- Start from the freeCodeCamp MCP basics and expand with real-world examples and tooling.
- Produce reusable templates and tests that make building internal MCP-powered services faster and safer.

## Goals

- Reproduce the freeCodeCamp MCP Basic tutorial exercises.
- Create `fastmcp`-based test templates and small servers you can customize for internal apps.
- Document setup, usage, and test patterns so teammates can onboard quickly.
- Provide examples and guidance for extending tests to cover authentication, storage, and inter-service communication.

## Scope / Contract

- Inputs: small MCP models and prompts, simple test cases, minimal environment (Python 3.10+ recommended).
- Outputs: working test examples using `fastmcp`, a tiny example server, README docs, and starter templates.
- Success criteria: examples that run locally, clear setup steps, and at least one test + server example.
